# Country-Covid-19-Tableau-Dashboard

## Introduction :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Project includes the Covid-19 Country wise information. In this we have all the information related to Active Cases, Death Cases, Confirmed Cases and Recovered Cases. It consist of total 187 Countries and shows the comparison between the countries based on the Covid Data. From this we can find that The United States had maximum confirmed cases followed by Brazil whereas Brazil had more recovered cases followed by US. This Project is helpful in gaining information about how many country suffered from Corona Virus and to whom it affect the most and to whom the least, which country has recovered earlier and which one later and etc. This Project will give you numerous information about the Covid-19 Country wise.

- Throughly understanding of the Data
- Identifing the Problem

## Project KPI :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, the generated Measures show the total active cases is 6.4M, the total confirmed cases is 16.5M, the total death cases is 0.7M and the total recoverd cases is 9.5M which was displayed in the form of KPI. From this, I came to know that out of total confirmed cases, 57.4% were recovered, 38.6% were active and 4.0% were dead. It means the medical facilities development were in the fast track that leads to lesser death than recovered.

## Conclusion :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Project is just for knowledge purpose with the motive of gaining qualitative information about the countries who have suffered from the Covid Pandemic. In the overview I can say that major countries that were affected by Corona are US, Brazil, India, UK, Russia etc. and these countries mostly belong from the regions Americans, South-East Asia and Europe. In these countries, better medical facilities are also available to deal with this infectious disease thats why their recovered cases was almost half and least were dead. This Dashboard is helpful to know the Worldwide history of 2020-21, the period of Covid-19 when almost whole country was under Quarentine.
